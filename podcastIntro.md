# The Stack Podcast

We are _the_ podcast about Urbit. Our earlier episodes (before episode 26) can all be found on our Soundcloud. There are very good episodes in there but it is from episode 26 onward that we started slouching toward professionalism.

_All The Stack episodes are perfect but some are more perfect than others._
