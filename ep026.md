# Introduction

This week we speak with ~finnem, finance maven from a secret haven in the land of guns, chocolate, and sausage respecting. The lady talks to us about the possible use cases of Urbit for making bank. No, for making a bank. A Swiss bank, which everyone knows is the best sort.

When not working at her computer, the Miss is an active shooter. No, that is, she actively shoots. And rather well, we’ve heard, as our Swiss Miss, ~finnem, is not a Swiss who misses. We talk about Rittenhouse’s form, if you’re into that sort of thing. We also do it if you’re not.

Naturally, we talk about being a woman on Urbit, which is _just an endlessly fascinating topic amirite?_
